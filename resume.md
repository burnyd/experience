## Publications / Speaking / Presontations.

[ONUG](https://onug.net/) - I have given seminars and technical track sessions on network automation, network programmability and tooling.

[NYNOG](https://www.nynog.org/events) - Talks on [Openconfig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6DY18y-bZ8) and [Kubernetes networking](https://www.nynog.org/events/2022/6/9/nynog-20) 

[Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com/companies/arista-networks/) - [Telegraf Cloudvision integration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erTGcvAm2zY&t=1s) 

[Arista Openconfig demos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6kEnPnH7OA5b_S_GFmylH1KGBRe01v5Y&si=Fp7yZ_cyYHlN1DKZ)

## Production tools / integrations.

**[Terraform provider](https://github.com/aristanetworks/terraform-provider-cloudvision)** - I maintain and authored a terraform plugin using Terraforms SDKv2 for the Arista Cloudvision software.  This is used within production at many organizations to treat Cloudvision similar to a cloud infrastructure with Terraform.

**[Telegraf integration](https://github.com/aristanetworks/telegraf-cloudvision)** - Telegraf third part integration to Cloudvision.  This is a plugin I developed to allow the streaming of network metrics from the gNMI interface of Cloudvision to anything within Telegraf.

**Kubernetes emulation environment** - Built a network emulation environment leveraging client-go and kubernetes clusters to allow the emulation of large network topologies anywhere a kubernetes cluster is present.

**Network CICD** - Worked with customers on integrating various tooling within their organization to treat network artifacts as code leveraging existing and new tooling to create a application like experience with network infrastructure changes.

**Kubernetes operators** - I have created kubernetes operators for specific customers for leveraging network changes using Redhats Operator framework.


## Professional certifications.

**CKA** - Certified Kubernetes Associated.

**CCIE RS** - Cisco Certified Industry Expert Routing & Switching #37401
